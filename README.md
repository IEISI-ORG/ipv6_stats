# IPv6 Testing and generating Adoption Stats

The ideas here is very simple, test and examine data on who has the most popular websites running IPv6.

I was recently at the APNIC-60 conference in Vietnam, where I tried being on ipv6-only for some time.

Google and other regular use sites worked, but GITHUB did not, and several ipv6 test sites also failed.
